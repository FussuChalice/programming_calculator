## Description
A simple and efficient **programmer's calculator** built with Flutter, designed for developers and tech enthusiasts. The calculator is **designed in the style of early macOS**, giving it a nostalgic and classic look. This project was created **for educational purposes**, to practice Flutter development, state management, and number system conversions.

## Features

- **Classic macOS-inspired design:** Nostalgic interface reminiscent of early Macintosh calculators.  
- **Basic operations:** Addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), and modulo (`mod`).  
- **Number system conversion:** Easily convert numbers between **Decimal**, **Binary**, **Octal**, and **Hexadecimal** systems.  
- **Manual conversion logic:** All number system conversions are implemented **manually**, without relying on external libraries.  
- **Clean UI & responsive buttons:** Designed for both usability and aesthetic appeal.  
- **Cross-platform:** Works on Android, iOS, and desktop platforms via Flutter.

## Usage

1. Enter numbers using the calculator buttons.  
2. Perform operations like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, or `mod`.
